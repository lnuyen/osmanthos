                    <h2>Blends</h2>
                    <p>Our custom blends are a great starting point for your fragrances. We created our blends to help you get started and we've tried countless combinations to help guide you.</p>
                    <p>We create our blends by combining undiluted raw materials and aging the mixture for one month or more. 
                    Many of our blends are aged in Sandalwood oil. Sandalwood's sweet, smooth oil casts beautiful effects on any material while also making scents last longer. 
                    These blends are inspired by the centuries old Indian tradition of Ittars. An ittar, or attar, is a highly concentrated, alcohol-free natural perfume made from botanical sources.</p>

                    <h4>How To Use</h4>
                    <p>Use blends (alone or in combination) as bases and build your fragrances around them.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.</strong> Start with a blend or combination of blends at 85% or higher.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.</strong> Add indiviual raw materials to make the fragrance uniquely yours.</p>

                    <h2>Raw Materials</h2>
                        <p>Raw materials are the individual ingredients that make up a perfume formula. There are
                            thousands of different raw materials sourced from all over the world. Rose, for example, comes
                            in hundreds of different forms depending on the type of rose, where it is grown, and how it is
                            extracted.</p>
                        <img src="<?php echo base_url('assets/public/images/how-to-guide/raw-material-directory.jpg') ?>" alt="scent market raw materials directory" style="border:1px solid #eee; margin-bottom:20px; width:700px;" />
                        <p>To get to know different raw materials, browse them in the <a href="<?php echo base_url('raw-materials'); ?>">directory</a> or while in the lab. 
                            Information is provided for each that will be very helpful while creating your fragrances. Here's what it all means!</p>
                        <h4 class="rm-header">1/ Scientific Name</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>If the raw material is natural, the scientific name is shown.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="rm-header">2/ Family</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Raw materials are organized into families that contain materials with simmilar scents. 
                                In the <a href="<?php echo base_url('raw-materials'); ?>">directory</a> you can filter raw materials by family to learn more about the scent and uses for the raw materials in each family. 
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="rm-header">3/ Scent</h4>
                        <p>Each raw material includes a short description of its scent. These words can describe many facets of scent including 
                            texture and strength. Like any language it may take time to fully understand the language of perfume. Phrases like powdery or 
                            balsamic make more sense as you become familiar with different types of smells over time.</p>
                        <h4 class="rm-header">4/ Note</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>Raw materials are classified as top notes, heart notes, or base notes according to their volatility, or how quickly their scent evaporates. Most fragrances are built with a combination of top, heart, and base notes to balance a fragrance as it evolves over time. A fragrance without base notes will be shortlived, and one without top notes will lack a strong impression upon first spritz. Heart notes round out a perfume by blending with the top notes and softening the harsher facets of the base notes.</p> 
                            <p><strong>&#9650; Top Notes</strong><br />
                            Oils with lighter molecules that evaporate the fastest, so when smelling a fragrance you smell them first.
                            They're the first impression of a fragrance, but they don't linger for long giving way to the heart and base notes.
                            Citrus raw materials are common top notes.</p> 
                            <p><strong>&hearts; Heart Notes</strong><br />
                            Heart notes round out a perfume by blending with the top notes and softening the harsher facets of the base notes. Most floral raw materials are heart notes, as well as many spicy raw materials.</p> 
                            <p><strong> &#9660;Base Notes</strong><br /> 
                            Evaporate the slowest, have the longest staying power and thus determine much of the character of a fragrance. Though top notes are responsible for the first impression, base notes last for hours on end. Woody, sweet, and balsamic raw materials are usually base notes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="rm-header">5/ Type</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>There are a lot of misconceptions about the ingredients used in fragrance. Natural ingredients are viewed as "good" while synthetic ingredients are viewed as "bad". 
                                In reality, synthetic ingredients make up to 80% of many modern perfumes and have been used prominently since the start of modern perfumery at the the turn of the 19th century.</p>

                            <p>Synthetic materials allow perfumers to expand their palettes, reinvent naturally occurring smells, and create entirely new smells. 
                                They are arguably less dangerous as allergens than natural materials because whereas rose oil may contain some hundreds of different molecules, a synthetic ingredient is composed of only one. 
                                Some synthetic molecules occur naturally in nature, and some are novel. For example, the molecule Citronellol occurs naturally in geranium, rose, and lemongrass, 
                                but it is also used on its own to add a floral-rosy, dusty, pepper, citronella note to a fragrance. 
                                In contrast, the molecule Lyral does not occur in nature and is used to add a muguet, green, aldehydic, fresh note.</p>
                            <p>Natural raw materials are derived from flowers, wood, fruit, and the like, but obviously your perfumes
                                don't contain wood chips and flower petals. Various methods are used to capture
                                natural scent and each method returns different results. This is why raw materials come in a number of types.</p>
                            <p>Many natural substances produce a variety of raw materials depending on the extraction method used and the part of the substance
                                that is extracted. For example, the bitter orange tree produces three common raw materials: <a href="<?php echo base_url('lab/petit-grain'); ?>" >petit grain</a> (steam distilled from
                                branches and leaves), 
                                <a href="<?php echo base_url('lab/neroli'); ?>" >neroli oil</a> 
                                (steam distilled from the flower), and 
                                <a href="<?php echo base_url('lab/orange-flower-absolute'); ?>" >orange flower absolute</a>
                                (extracted with alcohol from the flower). Rose absolute, obtained through alcohol extraction, and rose oil, obtained through steam distillation,
                                of the same rose plant also produce materials with different scents.</p>

                    <p>Anyone can improve their sense of smell by spending time getting to know different raw materials.</p> 
                    <p><strong>1/</strong> Smell individual raw materials often on blotters and observe how each scent evolves over
                    the course of a day. Top notes will move from strong to faint, while base notes soften and settle in over time.</p>
                    <p><strong>2/</strong> Blind tests are a great way to memorize different materials. Dip blotters in different raw materials, label them, then try to distinguish and identify them from memory.</p>
                    <p><strong>3/</strong> Dip multiple blotters in different raw materials and smell the blotters together like a fan to get an idea of how the materials smell in combination. Add and remove different raw materials to discover the effect each one has on the scent.</p>

                    <h2>Mods &amp; Sets</h2>
                    <h4>Mods</h4>
                    <p>"Mod" is industry speak for a fragrance formula. When working on a new fragrance, a perfumer may create tens to hundreds of mods before the formula is finalized. We call each formula you create on Scent Market a "mod".
                        When you create a new mod, you can either start from scratch or work from a formula you've already made. 
                        To begin from an existing formula, click a mod in <a  href="<?php echo base_url('account/mods'); ?>">My Mods</a> and click <span class="faux-button" style="background-color:rgb(172, 203, 232)">CREATE NEW MOD +</span>.</p>
                    <p>Before getting a formula just right, perfumers usually create many versions.  Rumor has it that Chanel No. 5 was the fifth 
                        version of the fragrance that perfumer Ernest Beaux presented to Coco Chanel, and that's how the fragrance got it's name.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>Sets</h4>
                    <p>A "set" is a group of three mods. You can select any three of your mods and create a set. The purpose of sets is to group similar mods and compare them to each other when creating your fragrances. It's easier to evaluate a mod when comparing it against other mods than to just smell it alone.
                       For example, if you are creating a floral scent, you might create a "Flower" set with three mods based on rose and jasmine.</p>
                    <img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>/assets/public/images/products/set.jpg" width="400">
                    <p class="tc"><small><em class="nc">A Scent Market Set</em></small></p> 
                    <p>To create a new set, simply go to <a  href="<?php echo base_url('account/sets'); ?>">My Sets</a> and click <span class="faux-button" style="background-color:rgb(172, 203, 232)">CREATE NEW SET +</span> at the top of the page.
                       When you order one of your sets we create a 2 ml sample of each mod for you to evaluate.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                    <p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when you evaluate your mods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Test on skin</strong><br />
                        Don't trust paper blotters when trying your mods. Fragrance smells different on skin, and on your skin is where you'll be wearing it; so do yourself a favor and try your mods on your skin!</p>
                    <p><strong>Smell top to bottom</strong><br /> 
                        Perfumes usually evolve over time&mdash;something you love at first sniff you may dislike soon after. And vice versa, of course.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rest your nose</strong><br />
                        Noses tune out. Don't smell too many scents per hour or per day, to keep your nose reliable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Check the radiance</strong><br />
                        Curious how your perfume will smell to other people as you walk past? Spray a blotter and leave it in the 
                        room while you step out for a bit. Come back fifteen minutes later and breathe in: that's the radiance.</p>

                    <h2>The Lab</h2>
                    <h4>1/ Take a look around</h4>
                    <p>In the lab you'll find all of the blends and raw materials that we have for you to use. Click the name of an ingredient to
                       get more information about that ingredient, such as the scent, family, or usage tips.  
                       </p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>2/ Select your ingredients</h4>
                    <p>Mouseover an ingredient's image and click + to add an ingredient to your formula.
                    Ingredients that you add to your formula will appear in the box above. 
                    You can add up to ten ingredients in each formula.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>3/ Adjust your formula</h4>
                    <p>The percentage is shown for each ingredient and changes automatically as you adjust the 
                    amount of each and add or remove ingredients. Click <span class="formula-button">+</span> or <span class="formula-button">−</span> to increase or decrease the amount of each ingredient. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that a powerful raw material can create a big impact at 1%. You can dilute stronger materials by increasing the
                        percentage of others. For further guidance, look to the specific information provided for each raw material.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>4/ Add to Collection</h4>
                    <p>When you've finished creating the formula for your mod, click <span class="faux-button" style="background-color:rgb(172, 203, 232)">ADD TO MY COLLECTION</span> to save. 
                        We recommend creating at least three mods and ordering them as a set so that you can evaluate and compare different mods at the same time.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top:40px;">Fragrance, Perfume &amp; Scent</h4>
                    <p>Many people think perfumery is as simple as identifying smells you like and 
                        combining them in a bottle. If only it were so easy. Professional
                        perfumers train for many years to memorize thousands of smells, learn how
                        different ingredients interact with each other, and find the perfect combination of materials to take a
                        fragrance from an idea to reality.</p>
                    <p>People come to Scent Market with different goals&mdash;to create a blend of your favorite raw materials,
                        to make something truly unique, or perhaps to experiment in the lab. 
                        Whatever your end goal, we guide you through the process of creating your own fragrance to help you create the best fragrance for 
                        you.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>1/ Identify What You Like</h4>
                    <p>An important step before you start creating a fragrance is to identify scents and styles that you
                        like. It helps to take a look at your favorite fragrances and try to pinpoint
                        why you love them &mdash; the way it makes you feel, a particular ingredient,
                        or perhaps the total package.</p>
                    <p>Like raw materials, fragrances are organized into families. There are
                        different classification systems &mdash; one popular system is
                        the <a href="http://www.fragrancesoftheworld.com/external/wheel/index.html" target="_blank">fragrance wheel</a>
                        created by fragrance expert Michael Edwards. The fragrance wheel contains
                        fourteen different families that are grouped next to similar families. If you find yourself
                        drawn to fragrances in one family, you may like fragrances in the neighboring families as
                        well. If it's not obvious where your favorite fragrances fall on the fragrance wheel, search for them in our <a href="fragrances">
                        directory</a> or at <a href="http://osmoz.com">osmoz.com</a> to find out the main
                        raw materials and family.</p>
                        <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>2/ Start Simple</h4>
                    <p>Most people know if they like jasmine, rose, or lemon &mdash; many do not know if they like lesser known ingredients like galbanum or hedione. 
                        Start by building a formula with ingredients you're familiar with, then experiment by adding new materials, or order a <a href="palettes">palette</a> to get to know new ingredients.
                    </p>
                        <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>3/ Build Character &amp; Add Dimension</h4>
                    <p>Once you have a starting point &mdash; ie. one of our blends blend, a floral bouquet, an amber base &mdash; begin to add character.</p>
                    <p style="padding-left:20px;">
                        <strong>Increase longevity</strong><br/>
                        Base notes evaporate the slowest, have the longest staying power and thus determine much of the character of a fragrance.<br/>
                        amber notes, woody notes, sweet notes, musk notes, leather<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Add character</strong><br/>
                        Heart notes follow the top notes and add character to the base notes.<br>
                        floral notes, fruity notes, spicy notes, green notes, aromatic/herbal notes<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Create a first impression</strong><br/>
                        Top notes are made up of lighter molecules that evaporate the fastest, so when smelling a fragrance you smell them first.<br>
                        citrus notes, aromatic/herbal notes, green notes, spicy notes<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Improve diffusion</strong><br/>
                        Diffusion refers to a fragrance's ability to spread and disperse through the air. Certain ingredients seemingly add lightness and airiness to a fragrance, helping to improve diffusion.<br>
                        hedione, iso e super<br/><br/>
                        <strong>Smooth rough edges</strong><br/>
                        Some fragrances feel a bit raw or rough around the edges. Certain ingredients are excellent at smoothing those rough edges and blending a fragrance together.<br>
                        vanilla, musk, benzoin
                    </p>
                        <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>4/ Experiment</h4>
                    <p>Create multiple mods from similar formula. To make modifications to an existing formula, click a mod in <a  href="<?php echo base_url('account/mods'); ?>">My Mods</a>, then click <span class="faux-button">CREATE NEW MOD +</span>.</p>
                        <div class="divider"></div>
                    <h4>5/ Inspiration</h4>
                    <p>Scent Market is full of resources to help you get started. Browse the raw materials and blends available for use in your fragrance, get inspired by our database of classic and popular fragrances on the market, or order a palette to sample ingredients before getting started.</p>

                    <p>When people withing the fragrance industry describe a scent it can sound like a foreign language: woody, aldehydic, powdery, balsamaic...But like anything else, it's important for professionals and non-professionals to be able to communicate. On that note, here are some common fragrance terms that result in blank stares or empty nods more often than not.</p>
                    <h4>Absolute</h4>
                    <p>Absolutes are essentially highly concentrated essential oils.</p>
                    <h4>Animalic</h4>
                    <p>Previously attributed to scents with animal-derived origins, most animalic ingredients today are aromachemicals. When smelled alone, animalic notes can be intense and unpleasant, but used in small amounts they add sensuality and depth to a fragrance.</p>
                    <h4>Aldehydic</h4>
                    <p>Aldehydes are synthetic materials popularized by the heavy use of them in Chanel No. 5. They are the same organic compounds as ketones and though their scents vary, they tend to add lift, air, and "sparkle" to a fragrance.</p>
                    <h4>Accord</h4>
                    <p>An accord is a combination of ingredients that together create the effect of another material. For example, you may see a ‘candied-cherry’ accord. A candied cherry cannot be bottled up and put in a fragrance, instead a perfumer will find a combination of ingredients that come together to create a ‘candied-cherry’ scent or effect.</p>
                    <h4>Aromatic</h4>
                    <p>This term refers to raw materials and notes that are vibrant, energetic, fresh. Aromatic notes are common in masculine fragrances.</p>
                    <h4>Balsamic</h4>
                    <p>Balsamic refers to a family of raw materials that are sweet, soft and warm. Most are derived from resins and gums and they're important in Oriental fragrances.</p>
                    <h4>Chypre</h4>
                    <p>Chypre (pronounced "sheepra") refers to a family of fragrances originating from the mossy, woody, citrusy perfume Chypre (Coty, 1917). Classic chypre fragrances generally had sparkling citrus and floral notes over a dark, earthy base of oakmoss, patchouli, woods and labdanum. Modern chypre fragrances use less (or zero) oakmoss due to regulatory restrictions; sometimes they use synthetic substitutes. </p>
                    <h4>Concentration</h4>
                    <p>Perfume is made up of scented oils and alcohol. The ratio of oil to alcohol is the "concentration" and it is typically between 10 to 20%. Parfum is the most concentrated form of fragrance and eau de cologne the least.</p>
                    <h4>Essential Oil</h4>
                    <p>An essential oil is a natural oil that carries the distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant (flowers, leaves, wood, bark, roots, seeds, or peel) from which it is derived.</p>
                    <h4>Flanker</h4>
                    <p>Flankers are like TV spinoffs, but if the original was a perfume and the spinoff was a twist or interpretation of that perfume. Flankers are ever popular today and some are less obvious than others. Bestseller Coco Mademoiselle, for example, is a flanker of the original Coco. Many flankers are released as limited editions. There have been nearly 20 flankers of L'Eau D'Issey Pour Homme released since the original was created in 1994. Usually, flankers have the same bottle as the original fragrance, but in different colors or with a different decoration.</p>
                    <h4>Fougère</h4>
                    <p>Fougère is a fragrance family (the word means 'fern' in French) originating from Fougère Royale (Houbigant, 1884). The fougère structure includes notes like lavender, coumarin, oakmoss, woods, and bergamot.</p>
                    <h4>Mod</h4>
                    <p>"Mod" is industry speak for a fragrance formula. We call each formula you create on Scent Market a "mod".</p>
                    <h4>Musk</h4>
                    <p>The name musk originates from an odorous substance obtained from a gland of the male musk deer that was historically used in perfumery. The name now encompasses a family of scents with similar odors. The musk odors used today are all aromachemicals.</p>
                    <h4>Note</h4>
                    <p>Notes are the raw materials or scents that make up a fragrance. A ‘note’ can be a single ingredient (natural or synthetic), or an accord.</p>
                    <h4>Palette</h4>
                    <p>A box of small samples of blends and raw materials. <a  href="<?php echo base_url('palettes'); ?>">Order a palette</a> to smell materials before or while creating your mods.</p>
                    <h4>Powdery</h4>
                    <p>Often, fragrance descriptions move beyond simple smells and refer to the perceived texture or aesthetic of the scent. The scent of jam is sticky, the scent of butter is creamy. A scent, such as iris, that is perceived as soft and somewhat dry is referred to as "powdery."</p>
                    <h4>Set</h4>
                    <p>A "set" is a group of three mods. You can select any three of your mods and create a set. The best way to evaluate your mods is to smell them against other mods.</p>
