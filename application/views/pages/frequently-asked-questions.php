							<dt>How do I create a fragrance?</dt>

Each kit is based around a featured ingredient and contains a curated selection of raw materials to explore.

							<dt>Are synthetic ingredients bad for me?</dt>
							<dd>No, in fact, many aroma molecules are found in nature. Hedione, a popular floral aroma molecule, occurs naturally in jasmine and tea. By isolating or synthesizing individual molecules like Hedione, perfumers are able to expand their palettes. Using aroma molecules allows perfumers to pick and choose their favorite facet of Jasmine, for example Hedione, and use that scent individually. Some aroma molecules don't occure in nature, but they add value because they have a unique scent that isn't found in nature or anywhere else.</dd>
